                    HTML/CSS are the basic foundation in which webpages are created. HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language" and CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". These two tools are the root of every webpage you see, including the text right here!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some frequently-used keywords in HTML/CSS include the following:
                    <strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>main</li>
                            <li>h1</li>
                            <li>div</li>
                            <li>margin</li>
                            <li>background-color</li>
                            <li>font-size</li>
                        </ul>
                    </strong>
                </p>

            </section><br>

            <section id="Prior_Knowledge_Needed" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1>Prior Knowledge Needed</h1>
                </header>

                <p>
                    Trick question! No prior knowledge is needed! All the things you need are:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer or Device to Code With</li>
                        <li>Desire and Willingness to Learn!</li>
                        <li>Patience and Perseverence</li>
                        <li>Curiosity to Make Something Cool!</li>
                        <li>An Imagination...</li>
                    </ul>

                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any or all of those things listed above, I'm sure you'll be a great web developer!
                </p>

            <section id="HTML" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1>HTML</h1>
                </header>

                <p>
                    At first, one may be intimidated by HTML. It looks like a weird mix of characters and weird formatting. However, do not worry! Things look a lot <s>worse</s> better than they may appear!
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, some common HTML elements include, but are not limited to, <code>main</code> and
                    <code>header</code>.
                </p>
            </section><br>

            <section id="CSS" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1>CSS</h1>
                </header>

                <p>
                    In the same way, CSS isn't that bad either! It's simply a way to add customization to the HTML elements you coded! These styling elements include properties such as <code>font-size</code>,
                    <code>background-color</code>, and <code>width</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although CSS may seem daunting, it gets a lot better with time as you understand the common features and styles of CSS that are typically used in webpages. And it doesn't take long to recognize the patterns!
                </p>

            <section id="Combining_HTML_and_CSS" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1>Combining HTML and CSS</h1>
                </header>

                <p>
                    Arguably the best (and most difficult) part of web development basics is combining HTML/CSS in a way that both looks aesthetically pleasing and is efficient in terms of code utilization. There are many pitfalls and errors that beginners typically <s>fall</s>                    descend into including:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Repeating the same lines of code in multiple places</li>
                    <li>Not understanding the distinction between IDs and Classes</li>
                    <li>Not understanding the correct instances in which to use different units (px, vh, vw, rem, em, %, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Forgetting to close elements with a "/" in the closing tag</li>
                    <li>Being unable to process basic syntax due to overlooking simple rules</li>
                </ol><br>
                <p>

                    Thus, that is pretty much all there is to working with HTML/CSS. It's not that bad at all, right! With enough practice, you'll be able to make a webpage like me! And I only started learning web dev a couple weeks ago! I hope you have a great experience
                    and build off of this foundation to even greater and awesome things in the future!
